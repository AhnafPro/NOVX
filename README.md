NOVX is a free electron-based private browser; it can be used to search
various sites privately without saving your visited website history (just search will be available and can be deleted too. ) The browser will be very beneficial in private areas like schools, offices etc. as if there is any theft or people get hands in your device they wont get to know which browser you are using.
Features I'll be adding/ trying to add
# built-in VPN
# ai chatbot
# history deleting
# death assumption system (if user is away from using the browser for certain amount of time period, the browser will wipe out its data for user safety.)
and much more...
Disclaimer: As I am better in frontend than backend I am transparent about using the help of ai to do the complex backend, Please excuse me ;)
[If you have seen the repo and thought the UI is bad, then let me tell you the UI will change a lot, and I mean it. as of now its just a base to see things working.]
